    "Two key questions for analyses of data in statistics are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Shape?\n",
    "2. Outliers/skew?\n",
    "\n",
    "For shape, we would like to know whether the distribution is **normal** (bell-shaped). Is it *uniform* meaning all outcomes are equally likely? Is it some other known distribution like the binomial distribution? The most significant shape for introductory statistics is the **normal distribution** since parametric statistical tests like the $z$-test, the $t$-test and ANOVA are built on assumptions of normality. The second question is whether or not skew and outliers exist because we often must treat skewed data and outliers with care and possibly different tools. The first steps of data analysis are to generate numeric descriptions of the data (descriptive statistics) and typical graphical displays of data like histograms, stem plots."

These two-player tournaments take less than half an hour where he either loses 21, or wins 19. (The online casino takes a cut of each tournament buy-in, called the *rake*.) Pete's HU20 win-loss record is *category data*, a series of W's and L's.\n",
