    "A *probability experiment* is any event whose outcomes are perfectly \\textbf{random} and exactly predicted by probabilities. The probability space (or sample space) is the collection of all possible outcomes of the experiment. A simple random sample (SRS) is a collection of outcomes drawn at random from the probability space $S$.\n",

    "An *event* is a set of *outcomes*. We use set notation: an event $A$ is a subset of $S$. Determining probabilities is all about counting the number of outcomes in event $A$ and in $S$. To simplify our work, we will use the \\textbf{cardinality} operator $n(A)$ to indicate \"the number of elements (outcomes) in set (event) $A$.\" This leads us to the main formula in discrete probability theory:"
